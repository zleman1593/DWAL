By directing your browser to this Website or otherwise accessing the pages of this Website, you accept these Terms of Use. Campus Confess may change the Terms of Use at any time at its sole discretion.

            <h2><strong>Personal Safety</strong></h2>
            <p>Campus Confess STRONGLY ADVISES YOU TO USE EXTREME CAUTION BEFORE SHARING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS OF THIS WEBSITE.

Campus Confess cannot and does not assure that it is safe for you to have direct contact with other users of this Website. Current technological developments make it possible for users of the Internet to obtain personal information about, and locate, other users, with very little other information. For example, it is possible to use certain widely available commercial Internet search engines to locate a person’s home solely using that person’s correct name. If you believe that any user of this Website is harassing you or is otherwise using personal information about you for unlawful purposes, we encourage you to first inform local law enforcement authorities and then to contact us at “contact@campusconfess.com” so that we may take appropriate action to block further use of the Website by any user who is using this Website and information obtained from it for improper purposes.
